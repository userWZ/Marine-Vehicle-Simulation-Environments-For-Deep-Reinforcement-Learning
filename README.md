# Marine Vehicle Simulation Environments For Deep Reinforcement Learning

The Vehicle Simulation Env is a gym environments for DRL,  based on the [MSS toolbox and Python Vehicle Simulator](https://github.com/cybergalactic/PythonVehicleSimulator)

This project is an Vehicle Simulation Environment for deep reinforcement learning, and it is based on [MSS toolbox and Python Vehicle Simulator](https://github.com/cybergalactic/PythonVehicleSimulator) written by Fosson et al and [gym](). It includes models for autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs), unmanned surface vehicles (USVs), and ships.

It includes the vehicle basic environment, path following environment, path following environment, obstacle avoidance environment, etc
